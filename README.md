Singly linked list is a type of data structure that is made up of nodes that are created using self referential structures. Each of these nodes contain two parts, namely the data and the reference to the next list node. Only the reference to the first list node is required to access the whole linked list. This is known as the head. The last node in the list points to nothing so it stores NULL in that part.

A program to implement singly linked list is given as follows.

First of all, I was the manager of this repo. And I decided to take singly linked list as topic to work. Decided a C++ code in order to run it and asked for my collaborators for the pull request. I added them and one by one they commited the code in order to get the program running. At the end, I resolved all the conflicts and merged all of them accordingly in order to get the complete code in this repo.
